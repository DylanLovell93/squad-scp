# ABBS`.`MD Squad Collaboration Project

## Project

    In this project, we're preparing a react-app as a visual aid for our LPD Squad collaboration presentation on 12/20.

## Squad Members

- [Angie Guerrero]()
- [Melissa Lopez]()
- [Bryant Mercedes]()
- [Sev Pekej]()
- [Dylan Lovell](https://github.com/DylanLovell93)
- [Bill Dominique]()

## Fellow objectives

1. Clone this repository (DON'T FORK)
2. Create a new branch for your work! (it's not a lot of work I promise)
3. Link your GitHub account to your name in the "Squad Members" version of the read-me (EX: Dylan's link works)
4. Add the appropriate data to 'data.js'
5. Add your own custom CSS to Bio.css! This will effect how your personal bio page looks (You may add more css, as long as it only effects your page, example below)
6. Add, commit, push, and create a pull request! Get those reps in! This is ABBS`.`MD! THIS CODE WILL WORK YOU OUT!

Example custom css:

```css
/* Dylan's Css */

.BioDylan {
  background-color: blue;
}
.BioDylan .Story {
  font-size: 20px;
}

/* Someone else's Css */
```
