      " My whole life until I got to my senior year of high school I wanted to be a doctor but for some reason that year it just wasn’t the same. I had done programs in Hospitals like Mount Sinai to prepare myself for this path which I believe was the right one for me but somehow that senior year my love for it just felt out the window. I dwindle in college for the next three years taking classes trying to find my passion but I didn’t. That’s when a cousin of mines told me about pursuit and coding. I didn’t think that I was going to like coding at all but through pursuit and hard work, I have come to like it a lot. I wouldn’t change anything about my past, of course, I would have liked to learn this was what I like to do earlier but I have to own my pursuit.",

      "I used to be one of those gifted children that didn’t have to study much to get good grades or ace a test. I had a good memory and I easily picked up on new concepts. I accelerated in most aspects of school but burnout soon set in due to such high expectations. I used to read college level books in fifth grade. But, as I got older and everyone kinda just evened out in high school, I was average. I never trained myself to study like my peers had and they were now comfortably set in their study routines. At that point in time I decided that if I didn’t want to fall behind, I’d have to put in the work. It wasn’t easy by any means. I had to teach myself self-discipline later in life compared to others but I’m grateful for past me deciding to do so. When I stumbled upon Pursuit I had to be able to make sure I put in the work. The only way I will be able to show off my skills and be set in my career is to show all I’ve learned but coding is a very different ballgame that you can’t just memorize some code and you’ve got an app. I have to actively review code and have genuine interest to set myself up for motivation to work for what I want. Im proud to say that I work really hard now to go after what I want. (:",
