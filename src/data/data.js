      'During my Fellowship at Pursuit, I have been struggling with understanding all of the concepts we have been learning. My ultimate goal is, for us all, to complete our Fellowship and start a career in technology. As the program has advanced, I have had the opportunity to work with most Fellows in my class. This has provided me with the opportunity to build strong relationships and to understand that we are all at different levels in our knowledge of technology. I have discovered, this is definitely a strength. The sense of community that we have created surrounding the idea of helping and supporting each other during this Fellowship has been very encouraging and helpful. As a result, I am confident that our continuing efforts to work as a team, will lead us to successfully complete our Pursuit Fellowship.',

      ' My whole life until I got to my senior year of high school I wanted to be a doctor but for some reason that year it just wasn’t the same. I had done programs in Hospitals like Mount Sinai to prepare myself for this path which I believe was the right one for me but somehow that senior year my love for it just felt out the window. I dwindle in college for the next three years taking classes trying to find my passion but I didn’t. That’s when a cousin of mines told me about pursuit and coding. I didn’t think that I was going to like coding at all but through pursuit and hard work, I have come to like it a lot. I wouldn’t change anything about my past, of course, I would have liked to learn this was what I like to do earlier but I have to own my pursuit.',

      'When I was growing up, I found it very normal to not have a father around as it was just my mom, brother and I. I was too young to establish a memory of him so there was no one to miss, just some questions. He showed up one day when I was 10 and even took me and my brother on a single trip with his son. He then disappeared again after maybe a year or 2 and now I was mostly angry and filled with a bunch of different emotions. “Why did he come back?”, “what makes him stay with his family?”, “Did I do something to make him leave?”,”Am I just a financial obligation?”(well, maybe not those words at the time). It took some time but eventually my brother and I came to the same conclusion. The answer to those questions didn’t matter, what was important was that we would someday be good fathers and we were going to redefine our last name so that we could be proud to pass it down to our kids. Imagine growing up and while other kids wanted to be doctors, lawyers, and professional sports player, dreaming about being a good parent. You ever heard the term, “turn something out of nothin?”, we took an absent father and made 2 good dads. I’m still a work in progress but I’m trying to grow and get better everyday, I’m owning my pursuit.',

      'I used to be one of those gifted children that didn’t have to study much to get good grades or ace a test. I had a good memory and I easily picked up on new concepts. I accelerated in most aspects of school but burnout soon set in due to such high expectations. I used to read college level books in fifth grade. But, as I got older and everyone kinda just evened out in high school, I was average. I never trained myself to study like my peers had and they were now comfortably set in their study routines. At that point in time I decided that if I didn’t want to fall behind, I’d have to put in the work. It wasn’t easy by any means. I had to teach myself self-discipline later in life compared to others but I’m grateful for past me deciding to do so. When I stumbled upon Pursuit I had to be able to make sure I put in the work. The only way I will be able to show off my skills and be set in my career is to show all I’ve learned but coding is a very different ballgame that you can’t just memorize some code and you’ve got an app. I have to actively review code and have genuine interest to set myself up for motivation to work for what I want. Im proud to say that I work really hard now to go after what I want. (:',

      'What does it mean to ‘Fail Forward’? It involves not understanding concepts right away. It means not getting the best grades on exams. It means that you can read code and translate it into Layman’s terms but struggle to convert it into Javascript. The list can go on and on. How do I move forward? I watch a lot of tutorials online. I consult with my peers and get different inputs from them. It means taking a ton of notes. I identify my strengths and weaknesses. I’m not afraid to fail. It gives me the opportunity to learn about myself and self-assess. I came into the program thinking that the work was going to be easy. To be honest, I’m glad it isn’t. I’ve learned so much between the summer and what is now, winter. The journey has been tough, but I’m still here, moving forward.',
