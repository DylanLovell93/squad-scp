    story: 'During my Fellowship at Pursuit, I have been struggling with understanding all of the concepts we have been learning. My ultimate goal is, for us all, to complete our Fellowship and start a career in technology. As the program has advanced, I have had the opportunity to work with most Fellows in my class. This has provided me with the opportunity to build strong relationships and to understand that we are all at different levels in our knowledge of technology. I have discovered, this is definitely a strength. The sense of community that we have created surrounding the idea of helping and supporting each other during this Fellowship has been very encouraging and helpful. As a result, I am confident that our continuing efforts to work as a team, will lead us to successfully complete our Pursuit Fellowship.',

      ' My whole life until I got to my senior year of high school I wanted to be a doctor but for some reason that year it just wasn’t the same. I had done programs in Hospitals like Mount Sinai to prepare myself for this path which I believe was the right one for me but somehow that senior year my love for it just felt out the window. I dwindle in college for the next three years taking classes trying to find my passion but I didn’t. That’s when a cousin of mines told me about pursuit and coding. I didn’t think that I was going to like coding at all but through pursuit and hard work, I have come to like it a lot. I wouldn’t change anything about my past, of course, I would have liked to learn this was what I like to do earlier but I have to own my pursuit.',

    story:
      'I used to be one of those gifted children that didn’t have to study much to get good grades or ace a test. I had a good memory and I easily picked up on new concepts. I accelerated in most aspects of school but burnout soon set in due to such high expectations. I used to read college level books in fifth grade. But, as I got older and everyone kinda just evened out in high school, I was average. I never trained myself to study like my peers had and they were now comfortably set in their study routines. At that point in time I decided that if I didn’t want to fall behind, I’d have to put in the work. It wasn’t easy by any means. I had to teach myself self-discipline later in life compared to others but I’m grateful for past me deciding to do so. When I stumbled upon Pursuit I had to be able to make sure I put in the work. The only way I will be able to show off my skills and be set in my career is to show all I’ve learned but coding is a very different ballgame that you can’t just memorize some code and you’ve got an app. I have to actively review code and have genuine interest to set myself up for motivation to work for what I want. Im proud to say that I work really hard now to go after what I want. (:',
