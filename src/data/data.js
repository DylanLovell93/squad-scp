      " My whole life until I got to my senior year of high school I wanted to be a doctor but for some reason that year it just wasn’t the same. I had done programs in Hospitals like Mount Sinai to prepare myself for this path which I believe was the right one for me but somehow that senior year my love for it just felt out the window. I dwindle in college for the next three years taking classes trying to find my passion but I didn’t. That’s when a cousin of mines told me about pursuit and coding. I didn’t think that I was going to like coding at all but through pursuit and hard work, I have come to like it a lot. I wouldn’t change anything about my past, of course, I would have liked to learn this was what I like to do earlier but I have to own my pursuit.",
